# junkEmailMover
This program was originally written by [Fran√ßois Martin](https://github.com/martinfrancois) due to the problem, that there is no junk mail forwarding available on some webmails. Since the junk mail filter recogniced more and more mails as spam (even though they were not), he decided to write this program. 

## What's next?
* Creating a documentation on how this works and can be configured.
* add here, what the system needs.
* Think about how it could be improved in the future.
